# ImageRenamer
This script reads the date taken from .jpg image files and renames them using the date taken as the file name.

The purpose of this project is to provide a tool that allows users to rename image files using the date taken as the file name. This can be useful for organizing and organizing image files, as the file name can quickly provide information about when the image was taken.
